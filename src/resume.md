## About Me

I wanted to work in TAC at Cisco when I took my first netacad course in 1999. I was a Sophomore in Highschool. I lived in poverty and couldn't imagine working on anything as nice as a functional network.

My mom got me my first computer at age 15. It was a Gateway 2000 machine that broke all the time, so I spent hours talking to tech support. Eventually I stopped needing to call in.

The poverty thing doesn't go away. I won't be diagnosed with ADHD for another 30 years. I'm not even going to find out my gender is female, for another 20 years.

My first wife puts me through college, that was tremendous, and I do get my dream job at Cisco, I'm finally an Engineer, not just a tech.

I named myself Ariadne, because fundamentally, I wanted to convey my ability others to navigate complex problems. *I love and adore troubleshooting.*

I have two other related websites.

[sitwithariadne.com](https://sitwithariadne.com) - This is for meditation oriented advice ... it's CC0 ... public domain.

[dbtwithariadne.com](https://dbtwithariadne.com) - This is for DBT - Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I use these materials to prevent deaths.

In my free time I do ... support for people trying to get their CCNAs online, Mermaid, or fix their 3D printers.

## Jobs

**TCE:** Technical Consulting Engineer.

**CSE:** Customer Support Engineer, the older term.

**HTTS:** High-Touch Technical Support. This is the tier above normal support. More time to work cases, but higher expectations for cases worked.

**Keywords:** Stuff I worked on. I'm not an expert in any of these things, my primary skill is becoming conversant enough with any network tech to reach case resolution.

### IPv6 Test Engineer - Cisco

Cisco - STO (Security and Trust Organization)

Jun 2016 – Jul 2020

Research Triangle Park, NC

Responsible for helping Cisco products achieve two IPv6 certifications: USGv6 and IPv6 Ready Logo.

USGv6 is a collection of purchasing requirements the US government uses for IPv6 readiness — many federal departments require this certification to procure equipment, making it directly tied to millions of dollars in public sector deals. IPv6 Ready Logo is the industry standard certification, covering fundamentals like SLAAC, neighbor discovery, and protocol correctness across a suite of 300+ tests.

Day-to-day work included managing the IPv6 testing infrastructure, automating tests, testing equipment, and advocating for IPv6 readiness across the company.

### IOS-XR CSE - Cisco

Cisco - TAC

Apr 2015 – Jul 2016

Research Triangle Park, NC

Continued TAC and IOS-XR support work. See earlier IOS-XR role for full scope.

### Network Engineer — Secant Technologies

Secant Technologies - Professional Services

Oct 2014 – Mar 2015

Kalamazoo, MI

Secant is an IT solutions provider and VAR serving education and commercial customers in the Kalamazoo area, offering network design, server co-location, structured cabling, managed services, and more.

Worked in Professional Services implementing solutions designed by pre-sales architects — switching, wireless, security, and voice, primarily Cisco with some Ubiquiti. Also handled escalated network tickets from existing customers that the service desk couldn't resolve.

### IOS-XR CSE - Cisco

Cisco - TAC

Jul 2012 – Oct 2014

Morrisville, NC

Part of a global team providing 24/7 support to customers running Cisco IOS-XR equipment — CRS, NCS6000 for core, ASR9000 for edge, and XRv as a virtual platform. Customers were typically ISPs and large enterprises requiring high-density, fault-tolerant routing at line-rate, with link speeds from 1Gbps to 100Gbps including G.709, DWDM, and TDM.

Support engineers owned cases end-to-end: updating documentation, filing bugs, engaging escalation resources, and managing a backlog. Setting correct expectations and delivering on them was central to the role.

Keywords: ATM, BGP, CEF, CEM, DHCP, DSL, DWDM, EIGRP, Ethernet, Frame Relay, GRE, HSRP, IGMP, IPv4, IPv6, IS-IS, L2VPN, L3VPN, LDP, MPLS, Multicast, OSPF, PIM, PPP, PPPoE, QoS, RADIUS, RIP, SNMP, SONET, SSH, STP, T1/T3, TCL, TDM, VRRP, VTP.

### IT Consultant - Bronson Hospital

Bronson Healthcare Group

Contract via Otterbase

Feb 2012 – Jul 2012

Kalamazoo, MI

The large local hospital needed someone to help change out hundreds of APs. I used Cisco NCS to locate them in diverse clinical environments including Surgery, Emergency, and Mother Baby. Performed wireless site surveys with AirMagnet to validate coverage after each replacement.

The priority was zero-disruption migrations — a single AP swap is usually harmless as devices roam to neighbors, but corner cases exist. The goal was a hard ceiling of 2 minutes of outage per AP, which in a hospital environment is significant. Tested, provisioned, installed, and retested hundreds of APs without a single complaint.

Also assisted the broader network team with fiber cross connects for redundancy, auditing unused access layer switch ports, and equipment upgrades.

## Projects

### Home Lab

### Proxmox

It's important to have a toybox, so here is my hypervisor setup. 1-3 are prod, 4-7 are experimental. I have problems with Quorum when 4-7 are off, which are on a separate circuit.

### Ceph

I built this trying to get kubernetes working. I realized I couldn't have dynamic state without finding a distributed filesystem.

```bash
ariadne@tiny-4:~$ sudo ceph status

  cluster:
    id:     06184e1d-d46d-43fb-80ef-8b485942ca80
    health: HEALTH_OK
 
  services:
    mon: 3 daemons, quorum tiny-5,tiny-4,tiny-7 (age 12d)
    mgr: tiny-5(active, since 2w), standbys: tiny-4, tiny-7
    mds: 1/1 daemons up, 2 standby
    osd: 4 osds: 4 up (since 13d), 4 in (since 7M)
 
  data:
    volumes: 1/1 healthy
    pools:   4 pools, 97 pgs
    objects: 7.92k objects, 30 GiB
    usage:   88 GiB used, 2.4 TiB / 2.5 TiB avail
    pgs:     97 active+clean
```

My first ceph cluster I tried with USB 3.0 thumbdrives ... ceph eats bandwidth, so this is backed with 20G port channels with NVME drives.

```bash
