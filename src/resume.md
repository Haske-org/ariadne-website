## About Me

I first heard about TAC in high-school. I grew up in poverty and Cisco was doing the Netacad program. Outreach. To me TAC was something mythical — a place where smart people worked on hard problems. 

Life is hard on the poor and undiagnosed. My parents divorced, I dropped out, to support my mom and work at Wal-Mart.

Getting into IT was hard. It took me nine years to finish my bachelors degree. Hard because of undiagnosed ADHD, CPTSD, and gender dysphoria.

With spouse help, I do finish college, get my first career job and finally access to mental health support.

Why is any of this relevant? Well ... CPTSD results in hyper-vigilance, the ability to detect signals in the faintest of noise. My internal identity is customer support, finding and troubleshooting problems.

I picked the name Ariadne so others would know immediately, I'm well suited to labyrinthine problems. I love this stuff.

In my free time I do ... more customer service stuff, just for different things: meditation, mental-health, 3D printers, freediving, and of course ... networking.

## Jobs

**TCE:** Technical Consulting Engineer.

**CSE:** Customer Support Engineer, the older term.

**HTTS:** High-Touch Technical Support. This is the tier above normal support. More time to work cases, but higher expectations for cases worked.

**Keywords:** Stuff I worked on. I'm not an expert in any of these things, my primary skill is becoming conversant enough with any network tech to reach case resolution.

Jun 2016 – Jul 2020

Research Triangle Park, NC

Supported Cisco's Security and Trust Organization in achieving and maintaining two critical IPv6 certifications: USGv6 and IPv6 Ready Logo. USGv6 is a US government procurement standard directly tied to federal purchasing eligibility across defense and civilian agencies, representing significant public sector revenue. IPv6 Ready Logo is the industry-standard certification validating protocol correctness across a suite of 300+ tests covering SLAAC, neighbor discovery, and core IPv6 fundamentals.

Day-to-day responsibilities included managing IPv6 testing infrastructure, developing and automating test suites, validating Cisco products against certification requirements, and advocating for IPv6 readiness across internal engineering teams. Maintained external industry engagement through participation in networking conferences and standards community events.

### IOS-XR CSE - Cisco

Apr 2015 – Jul 2016

Research Triangle Park, NC

Continued Tier 3 TAC support for IOS-XR platforms with a focus on ISP customers running CRS and XR 12000 series equipment. Core case work centered on MPLS, L3VPN, and SP-grade routing environments.

### Network Engineer — Secant Technologies

Secant Technologies - Professional Services

Oct 2014 – Mar 2015

Kalamazoo, MI

Secant is an IT solutions provider and VAR serving education and commercial customers in the Kalamazoo area, offering network design, server co-location, structured cabling, managed services, and more.

Worked in Professional Services implementing solutions designed by pre-sales architects — switching, wireless, security, and voice, primarily Cisco with some Ubiquiti. Also handled escalated network tickets from existing customers that the service desk couldn't resolve.

### IOS-XR CSE - Cisco

Cisco - TAC

Jul 2012 – Oct 2014

Morrisville, NC

Part of a global team providing 24/7 Tier 3 support to ISPs and large enterprises running Cisco IOS-XR platforms — CRS and NCS 6000 for core routing, ASR 9000 for edge, and XRv as a virtual platform. Supported high-density, fault-tolerant environments operating at line rate across link speeds from 1Gbps to 100Gbps, including G.709, DWDM, and TDM transport.

Owned cases end-to-end: reproducing complex faults, filing bugs, engaging escalation resources, updating documentation, and managing an active backlog — with an emphasis on setting accurate customer expectations and delivering on them. Specialized in WAN technologies including MPLS, L3VPN, and arcane but business-critical protocols such as Circuit Emulation Service (CEM) and Multilink PPP — serving as one of the only engineers on the team with deep CEM expertise.

### IT Consultant - Bronson Hospital

Bronson Healthcare Group

Contract via Otterbase

Feb 2012 – Jul 2012

Kalamazoo, MI

The large local hospital needed someone to help change out hundreds of APs. I used Cisco NCS to locate them in diverse clinical environments including Surgery, Emergency, and Mother Baby. Performed wireless site surveys with AirMagnet to validate coverage after each replacement.

The priority was zero-disruption migrations — a single AP swap is usually harmless as devices roam to neighbors, but corner cases exist. The goal was a hard ceiling of 2 minutes of outage per AP, which in a hospital environment is significant. Tested, provisioned, installed, and retested hundreds of APs without a single complaint.

Also assisted the broader network team with fiber cross connects for redundancy, auditing unused access layer switch ports, and equipment upgrades.

## Projects

### Home Lab

### Proxmox

It's important to have a toybox, so here is my hypervisor setup. 1-3 are prod, 4-7 are experimental. I have problems with Quorum when 4-7 are off, which are on a separate circuit.

```bash
ariadne@tiny-4:~$ sudo pvesh get /nodes

### Ceph

I built this trying to get kubernetes working. I realized I couldn't have dynamic state without finding a distributed filesystem.

```bash
ariadne@tiny-4:~$ sudo ceph status

  cluster:
    id:     06184e1d-d46d-43fb-80ef-8b485942ca80
    health: HEALTH_OK
 
  services:
    mon: 3 daemons, quorum tiny-5,tiny-4,tiny-7 (age 12d)
    mgr: tiny-5(active, since 2w), standbys: tiny-4, tiny-7
    mds: 1/1 daemons up, 2 standby
    osd: 4 osds: 4 up (since 13d), 4 in (since 7M)
 
  data:
    volumes: 1/1 healthy
    pools:   4 pools, 97 pgs
    objects: 7.92k objects, 30 GiB
    usage:   88 GiB used, 2.4 TiB / 2.5 TiB avail
    pgs:     97 active+clean
```

My first ceph cluster I tried with USB 3.0 thumbdrives ... ceph eats bandwidth, so this is backed with 20G port channels with NVME drives.

```bash

ariadne@tiny-4:~$ sudo rados bench -p rbd 10 write --no-cleanup
